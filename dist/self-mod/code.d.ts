/**
 * Self-Modification Engine
 *
 * Allows the automaton to edit its own code and configuration.
 * All changes are audited, rate-limited, and some paths are protected.
 *
 * Safety model inspired by nanoclaw's trust boundary architecture:
 * - Hard-coded invariants that can NEVER be modified by the agent
 * - The safety enforcement code is immutable from the agent's perspective
 * - Pre-modification snapshots via git
 * - Rate limiting on modification frequency
 * - Symlink resolution before path validation
 * - Maximum diff size enforcement
